# Lantern
**Created for the Blue Ocean Business Competition as a proof of concept**  
Lantern was intended to be a Reddit-Like website for tourism. It was supposed to recommend users new places to visit based on their voting history, other users' voting history, and configured interests.

The project's front-end, an Angular 4 App, was completed and the backend can be easily plugged into the frontend. Backend development has not yet begun.
